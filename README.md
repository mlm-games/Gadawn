What is Godawn
--
Godawn is a free and open source [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) made using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) Game Engine.

> Note: Godawn is only for minimal use cases, as there are some things that using gdscript cannot replicate (and do not want to use C++, have a lot of stuff that already takes a lot of my time.) If you would like help with the project or donate for my time, please feel free to. (although consider donating to GodDAW devs first for the foundation!)

Running
--
Godawn is developed using Godot 4. As of now Godawn is entirely made in GDScript so the Mono version is not needed, but should work.
