What is Godawn
--
Godawn is a free and open source [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) made using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) Game Engine.

> Note: Godawn is only for minimal use cases, as there are some things that using gdscript cannot replicate (and do not want to use C++, have a lot of stuff that already takes a lot of my time.) If you would like help with the project or donate for my time, please feel free to. (although consider donating to GodDAW devs first!)

While Godot was intended to be used as a game engine, it has a very flexible API that allows for non-game applications, especially since the Godot Editor is itself built with Godot. Some examples include [Pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) and [Material Maker](https://github.com/RodZill4/material-maker), which deal with images and texturing respectively. Godot also provides a decent audio API, and there was a distinct lack of Godot projects that use it for more than just playing sounds. Hence, Godawn was born.

In all honesty though, the Godawn pun was too good to pass up, thanks to [@luiq54](https://github.com/luiq54) from the Pixelorama Discord server for the name!

As of commit [27e4e20](https://github.com/QuadCubedStudios/Godawn/commit/27e4e20d0f59e207047c0da10054ef34ad062f6e)

Running
--
Godawn is developed using Godot 4. As of now Godawn is entirely made in GDScript so the Mono version is not needed, but should work.
